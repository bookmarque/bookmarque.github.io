## Poetry Challenge

During lockdown, my friend and I have been posing various poetry challenges to keep ourselves writing. Here we set the task of writing a villanelle. Some inspiring villanelles include Auden's 'If I could tell you' and Dylan Thomas's 'Do not go gentle into that good night'.
The villanelle form demands a tight, limited rhyme scheme and also the use of line repetition. I took some inspiration from the ennui of lockdown...

## Lift your gaze

Breath deep and count the hours of the days;

Darks nights are far behind us now and so

The time has come for you to lift your gaze.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The golden sun sets grim despair ablaze,

Lush fields grow fast in rain as well you know.

Breath deep and count the hours of the days.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

On paths you meet, distant, on warm Sundays,

You smile and speak a sweet, nervous ‘hello’.

The time has come for you to lift your gaze.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

I try to think of a perfect noun-phrase,

As I sit here, words flying to and fro.

Breath deep and count the hours of the days.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

It’s easy to get stuck in your old ways,

Now you are free to shrink and hide although 

The time has come for you to lift your gaze.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

So don’t miss all and hope that dusk delays,

Like daffodils, you need the sun to grow.

Breath deep and count the hours of the days,

The time has come for you to lift your gaze.
