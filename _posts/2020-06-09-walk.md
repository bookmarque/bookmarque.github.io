### Walk

<p>&nbsp;</p>


Amid the darkening mauve of dusk

is a sliver of white light, which will

Mirror the sweet glow of dayâ€™s delay.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


A haze lingers over the common

while you walk, his warm left hand in your

Cold right hand. This is a well-worn path.


<p>&nbsp;</p>

Footsteps on overgrown grass bring to

Mind old poems from lower sixth. The

Poet paints the hours as they pass. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>

#### Golden Shovel Poetry Challenge

I have chosen a much-loved line from Auden's 'O Where are you going?' as the thread of my golden shovel. For the uninitiated, a golden shovel is a form which responds to a line of poetry, and that line forms the final word of each line of verse.
I studied an anthology of Auden poems during year 12, and it was probably the first time poetry had really felt meaningful to me. The line 'dusk will delay on your path to the pass' has always evoked in me a sense of anxiety around freedom, choices and dreams, which even as a rather sheltered 17 years felt resonant.
